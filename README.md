# Product Sale Forecasting 
The goal of this proect is to build a Realtime multivariate sales forecasting model using deep learning techniques which can be deployed into production using MLOps infrastructure. This practice will ensure C-Level executives to take business actions to drive revenue based of product forecasts.

## Objective
In this repo we will build a multivariate time series model using different machine/deep learning techniques to forecast multiple products in different stores. 

## Time Series Analysis
The data used here is taken from Kaggle's Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge. Below you see a snap shot example of sales of item2 from store 1.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
### Yearly growth of sales per store
