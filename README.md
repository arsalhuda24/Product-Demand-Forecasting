# Product-Demand-Forecasting
## Objective
In this repo we will build a multivariate time series model using different machine/deep learning techniques to forecast multiple products in different stores. 

## Time Series Analysis
The data used here is taken from Kaggle's Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge. Below you see a snap shot example of sales of item2 from store 1.
